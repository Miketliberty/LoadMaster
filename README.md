This class project is desinged to be able to create a load sheet specificaly designed for a A330-3 aircraft. This website will allow users to imput the information that is
needed for load master to correctly load the aircraft and will warn the user if they have incorrectly loaded the plane with the amount of weight of the cargo.

Code used in the Project: HTML and JavaScript 

Class Project
Summary: Based on your Class Project proposal, you are going to have the opportunity to deliver something uniquely your own.
Prerequisites:
Class Project Proposal
In this activity you will deliver a class project that is uniquely your own. What you create should include the features defined in your final project proposal. As much as possible the features should be implemented in the priority order that you identified in your proposal.

Itâ€™s understandable that you may not be able to implement all of the features that you identified. However, you will need to make sure that your finished product implements sufficient features to be a complete and usable product.

Requirement 1
Create a product based on your Class Project Proposal by:

Successfully deploying your application to an appropriate production environment
Making the source code available for review by sharing your public GitHub repository URL
Include a help system and user instructions that succinctly describes the application and how it works
Update your README.md to reference your Class Project Proposal and to document what was delivered from the proposal
Requirement 2
Implement at least four (4) meaningful features that are of similar complexity to features we delivered in previous applications. Identify them in your Class Project Proposal

Requirement 3
Enhance your application so that it implements at least two (2) meaningful features that are greater in complexity than features we delivered previously in class. Identify them in your Class Project Proposal

Requirement 4
Create and deliver a Class Project Presentation to your classmates during our scheduled Final Exam time:

An overview of your Class Project Proposal including a description of what was completed
A demonstration of your product running focusing on the greater in complexity features that were delivered
Show your code while once again focusing on your greater in complexity code
Finally, provide a quick overview of what you would have liked to complete if you had more time
